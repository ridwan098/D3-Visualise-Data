# D3-Visualise-Data
This project visualises data with D3 using a scatterplot graph. The data being displayed is the level of Doping in Professional Bicycle Racing. To preview a specific incident, simply hover over the area.

This project was inspired and created for my freecodecamp data visualisation certificate.
